<center><h3>My Experience</h3></center>

<p>I had working experience during my study life. Last year, I have worked at Fu Hao Manufacturing that stated at Penang. It's a plastic factory that produce plastic parts such as gun cover, plastic mould and more. My reason to applying job at Penang because I have to finish last sem which is internship. So far, there's a worst experience ever to work there beacuse I have to expose myself and communicate with foreign! I'm so scraed to be honest!</p>

<p>Now my part time job is businesswomen. I'm selling my own brand and others. My own brand is Best Bawal & Aeisyah's PowerPuff. Others brand that i said are NILOFA Banana Milk & DEMICA products. Alhamdulillah, from these experience I can support myself and family ! I'm so happy with my achievement.
